### The MakeCode Editor

Created by the micro:bit Foundation, the **MakeCode editor** has everything you need to get started coding on micro:bit. 

![](images/makecode-tour.png)

On the left side there is a **simulator**, this contains a virtual micro:bit that you can use to test your code! 

It has all the features and buttons found on a V2 micro:bit, including:
+ LED Display
+ Speaker
+ Microphone
+ Input buttons
    + A
    + B
    + Shake

In the centre there is the **blocks panel** which is colour coded and allows you to access various code blocks.

On the right side there is a main **code editor panel** to drag and drop blocks into when creating your program.
