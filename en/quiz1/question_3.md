Here is the code for the music player program.



The `tune` variable is currently set to `1`.

Which melody will play when Button `B` is pressed?

- ( ) `wawawawaa`

Not quite. Button B skips the track forward and will add one to the variable value, meaning tune will be set to `2`, which is associated with the `punchline` melody

- (x) `punchline`

  --- feedback ---

Great! Pressing Button B will add one to the variable value, meaning tune will be set to `2`, which is associated with the `punchline` melody

- ( ) `dadadum`

  --- feedback ---

Not quite. The variable value is `1` and Button B adds `1` to the variable value, meaning the melody associated with value 1 (`dadadum`) will no longer play.
