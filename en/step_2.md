### Play melody


You are going to use the `forever` block to make use of the speaker output on the micro:bit (V2 users only).

--- collapse ---
---
title: V1 micro:bit users
---

The speaker output is only available on the V2 of the micro:bit. You will need to connect external headphones/speakers to play sound on the V1. You will still be able to play the sound on the simulator.

--- task ---

From the music block, drag the `play melody... dadadum.. in background` block and place it inside the `forever` block.

On the `play melody... dadadum.. in background` block, click on the down arrow next to the 'in background' button. Choose 'until done' as the option for how long the melody will play.

<div style="position:relative;height:calc(300px + 5em);width:100%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:relative;top:0;left:0;width:75%;height:75%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/---codeembed#pub:_Tr00PpKK07YM" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>

--- /task ---

When you make a change to a code block in the code editor panel, the simulator will restart.

**Test** When the program runs, you should now hear the melody playing until it's done. 

Well done, you have created your first music program on a micro:bit!
