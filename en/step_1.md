## You will make
Do you listen to music on Spotify, Apple music, Alexa or any other app? What if you could do the same on your micro:bit by creating your own music app.

In this project, you are going to make a music player that lets you choose different songs to suit your mood.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Listening to music can improve your <span style="color: #0faeb0">mood</span> making you feel happier! When you listen to music you enjoy, your brain releases a special 'feel-good' chemical. So, the next time you're feeling a little down, try putting on your favorite tunes and let the music boost your mood!
</p>

You will:
+ Use your micro:bit to play music
+ Use variables and logic to allow for a choice of melody
+ Use input buttons and gestures to control the playback
+ Share your project with others so they can try it out and you can get feedback
