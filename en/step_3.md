### Creating a variable

Throughout creating your music player, you will need to use variables. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
What is a <span style="color: #0faeb0">variable?</span>

A variable is like a special box where we can keep different pieces of information. Sometimes it might hold a number like `10` or it might hold a word like `dinosaur`.

Click on the `Variables` block menu to expand it. When open, click on the `Make a Variable` button.

Name your variable `tune`, then click the `OK` button.

--- /task ---

There will now be new blocks available that you can use to set, change or use the value stored in the `tune` variable.

--- task ---

Drag out the `set [tune] to 0` block inside the `on start` block and change the `0` to `1`.

### Using conditional logic

In order for your music player to play different melody choices, you will need to make use of a logic block for each melody.

--- task ---

From the Logic menu, click on the `if.. true.. then.. else` block and drag it inside the `forever` block. It should click below the `play melody... dadadum.. until forever` block
