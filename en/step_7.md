Great work! You have created your micro:bit music player. Here are some ideas to upgrade your project and create a more advanced music player app:

+ Add more melodies and increase the range on the shuffle.
+ Use the Logo button (Or button A+B on the V1) to stop all sounds, leaving Shake to just control the shuffle.
+ Use the Logo button (Or button A+B on the V1) to play a favourite melody.
